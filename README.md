# 1-1-Mini-Project
I wanted to develop a mini project every sem during my B.Tech using the core subjects in that sem. 
I had C programming in 1-1 and I want to develop a managament system and thought that movie booking system would be interesting and went with the project.
I thought that I can just try out some simple projects and that was this. 
Go through the code and any suggestions are welcomed.
