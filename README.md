# 1-1-Mini-Project
I wanted to develop a mini project every sem during my B.Tech using the core subjects in that sem. 
I had C programming in 1-1 and I came with the idea of  because at that time even covid was at high peak. I thought that I can just try out some simple projects and that was this. 
Go through the code and any suggestions are welcomed.
